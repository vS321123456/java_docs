# What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects in programming. It defines a set of properties (fields/attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions) that the created objects will have. You can think of a class like an architectural plan, and the objects are the actual buildings constructed based on that plan.

For example, a `Car` class might have properties like `color`, `model`, and `speed`, and behaviors like `drive()` and `stop()`. When you create an object of the `Car` class, you get a specific car with its own color, model, and speed.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) vs Functional Programming (FP)

## Main Concept:

- **OOP:** The main concept revolves around **objects** — entities that encapsulate both data and behavior.
- **FP:** The main concept is **functions** — pure functions that avoid changing state or mutable data.

## Execution Style:

- **FP:** Works best where the order of function execution doesn’t matter much, because functions are stateless and don’t have side effects.
- **OOP:** Allows you to organize code around objects that maintain state, making program execution more structured and intuitive, especially for modeling real-world entities.

# Why Do We Need Object-Oriented Programming?

Programming is a constant balance between maintainability, scalability, development speed, code quality, and reliability. OOP addresses many of these concerns by providing powerful advantages:

1. **Modularity**  
   OOP encourages dividing the program into modules or classes, each responsible for a specific part of the system. This creates low cohesion within modules (each has a focused responsibility) and less coupling between them (modules don’t overly depend on each other), which means the system is easier to understand and modify.

2. **Scalability**  
   Because of modularity, OOP systems can be easily extended. New functionality can be added by creating new classes or extending existing ones without altering the entire codebase. This makes large-scale systems easier to build and maintain.

3. **Lower Cost of Development (Code Reuse)**  
   OOP promotes code reuse through mechanisms like inheritance and polymorphism. Developers can build on existing classes, reducing duplication, saving time, and minimizing errors.

4. **Security & Reliability**  
   By encapsulating data within objects and controlling access via methods, OOP helps protect the internal state of objects from unwanted interference, enhancing security. Also, the structured nature of OOP leads to more reliable and predictable code behavior.

# Programming Trade-offs

Programming — whether OOP, functional, or other paradigms — is about making trade-offs. No approach is perfect; each comes with its strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to balance:

- **Maintainability:** How easy it is to update and improve the code.
- **Scalability:** How well the system can grow in size and complexity.
- **Speed of Development:** How quickly features can be delivered.
- **Code Quality:** How readable, clean, and bug-free the code is.
- **Reliability:** How consistently the code performs without failure.

OOP shines in many applications because it provides a framework to organize code logically and manage complexity, making trade-offs in a way that generally benefits long-term software projects.
